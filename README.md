# Lab_3_a_c_Sorts_
~This program is combined Lab.3a and Lab.3c. Two modes provided: demo and benchmark(results are accessible in separate file). Benchmark was done
for three different types of array: random array, almost sorted array, almost sorted array but in reverse order.
~About Lab.3a: sorts provided: insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort(top-down) and smart merge sort(in small subarrays we use insertion sort) for different limits(their comparison also provided in benchmark). Comparison with std::qsort also provided.
~About Lab.3c: sorts provided: shell sort for 3 different gaps(their comparison also provided in benchmark), binary tree sort.
Last sort could be improved by balancing our tree.
